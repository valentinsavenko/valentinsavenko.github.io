  title: "Who am I?"
  content: "<p class=\"lead\">
      DevOps Engineer, located in Berlin, with a bias for fast iterations and automation.
      I enjoy unraveling complex systems and developing tools to fast-track progress.
    </p>
    <p class=\"lead\">
      First and foremost, I am a problem solver; programming is just a concise way of writing down one possible solution. 
    </p>
    <p class=\"lead\">
      I enjoy working in small, focused teams with aligned goals and clearity on how tasks flow through the team. Recognizing that not every team may initially meet these criteria, I also like morphing tools and processes to help teams approach these high standards.
    </p>
